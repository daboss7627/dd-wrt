.SH NAME
poundctl \- control the pound daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B poundctl
[\fB\-c \fIFILE\fR]
[\fB\-i \fIN\fR]
[\fB\-j\fR]
[\fB\-s \fISOCKET\fR]
[\fB\-h\fR]
\fICOMMAND\fR
[\fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR]
[\fIARG\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays status and controls various objects in the running instance
of
.BR pound (8)
proxy server.
.PP
The program communicates with the running
.BR pound
program via a UNIX \fIcontrol socket\fR.  The
.B pound.cfg
file must contain a
.B Control
statement for this to work.  By default,
.B poundctl
will open the default
.B pound.cfg
file, look up for this statement and use the pathname defined by it as
the control socket file.  This can be altered in two ways.  First, if
using the configuration file in a non-standard location, the pathname
of this file can be given to the program using the
.B \-c
command line option.  Secondly, the socket name can be supplied in the
command line explicitly, using the
.B \-s
option.
.PP
The \fICOMMAND\fR argument instructs the program what action it
is supposed to perform.  Missing \fICOMMAND\fR is equivalent to
.BR list .
All commands take the \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR argument, which
specifies the
.B pound
object to apply the command to.  Here, \fIL\fR, \fIS\fR, and \fIB\fR
stand for the numbers of \fIlistener\fR, \fIservice\fR and
\fIbackend\fR, correspondingly.  Depending on the command, either
\fIB\fR or both /\fIS\fR/\fIB\fR/ may be omitted.  For example,
the following command will disable backend 2 in service 1 of listener 0:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /0/1/2
.EE
.PP
In contrast, the following command disables the listener 0 itself:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /0
.EE
.PP
A dash in place of \fIL\fR stands for global scope.  Thus, e.g.:
.PP
.EX
poundctl disable /-/1
.EE
.PP
disables the service 1 defined in the global scope of
.BR pound.cfg .
.PP
The following commands are available:
.TP
\fBlist\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
List status of the given object and its subordinates.  Without
argument, shows all listeners and underlying objects.
.TP

Enable listener, service, or backend.
.TP
\fBon\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Same as \fBenable\fR.
.TP
\fBdisable\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Disable listener, service, or backend.
.TP
\fBoff\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fB/\fIB\fR
Same as \fBdisable\fR.
.TP
\fBdelete\fR \fB/\fIL\fB/\fIS\fR \fIKEY\fR
Delete session with the given key.  Notice that backend may not be
specified.
.TP
